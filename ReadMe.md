## The Terminator

### This is a game with an objective to find someone before your ammo runs out.
### You will lose ammo with every button you click, as you search for Sarah Connor.

#### The main idea was to set up the page with some simple buttons with simple styling. I used jQuery to add events on certain buttons that were clicked, and to also change the ammo counter that would change after each click.
#### Technologies used:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. jQuery
4. @font-famly to source a new font to use.


#### Instructions are pretty straightforward. I have to make sure the user starts with a certain button, then gets ammo to start however.

## Unsolved Problems
1. I couldn't randomize which buttons my targets would go to.
2. When ammo was out, it would still say the end game message.
3. Adding classes to certain buttons to show images when the button had a certain class.
4. Checking to see if elements still had events bound to them. This would be quite handy.
